# Advent of Code 2023

Not really going for points here, just for fun :).

I'll probably try to vary languages a bit to get some variety.

## Notes

- I try not to use regex if I can help it (regex kinda takes the fun out of it and is harder to optimise if you are actually going for performance).
- Solutions are tidied up _a bit_, but not a lot. So this is definitely nowhere close being elegant code in a lot of cases.

## Solutions

### [Day 1](day1/)
**Language**: Python 3.12 (generics used)

### [Day 2](day2/)
**Language**: Python 3

### [Day 3](day3/)
**Language**: TypeScript (Deno)

**Note**: This one was re-written because what I initially wrote belongs on [r/programminghorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/).

### [Day 4](day4/)
**Language**: Golang

### [Day 5](day5/)
**Language**: Kotlin

**Note**: Here begin the optimisations! (some people got away with brute force, I decided not to even go there).

### [Day 6](day6/)
**Language**: Haskell
